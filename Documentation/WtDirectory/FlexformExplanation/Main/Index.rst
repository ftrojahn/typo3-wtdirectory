.. ### BEGIN~OF~TABLE ###

.. container:: table-row

   a
         **Show only this addresses**
   
   b
         Define an address pool (one or more addresses). This could be useful
         if you want to show only one address, etc... Note: If you choose a
         startingpoint and save, only the addresses of the startingpoint will
         be shown. Note2: Category usage is not available within an
         addresspool. Note3: ABC and Search filter can be used with this.


.. container:: table-row

   a
         **Category usage**
   
   b
         Category mode: Show only selected category or show all tt\_address
         records from page


.. container:: table-row

   a
         **Categories**
   
   b
         Choose one or more categories to show (If you want to use category
         dropdown, choose some!)


.. container:: table-row

   a
         **Don't show addresses on start**
   
   b
         Maybe you don't want to show addresses if no filter was chosen
         (category or ABC or searchfilter) – so you could speed up the site
         entry at the first time)


.. container:: table-row

   a
         **Startingpoint**
   
   b
         Choose page with tt\_address records (If empty, all addresses will be
         shown)


.. container:: table-row

   a
         **Recursive**
   
   b
         Take categories of startingpoint and maybe of some pages below the
         startingpoint(e.g. taking addresses from more sysfolders)
